## cloud? dude! are you talking about Google drive?!

Well...... not quite :)

ًًWhile famous services such as Google drive, Mega, Dropbox are what come to mind when someone mentions the cloud. These Services are considered **Cloud Storage**. When it comes to a really broad term like the cloud, cloud storage is one of numerous things that fall under cloud, in other words storage is just the tip of the iceberg!

### Understanding cloud computing.

**cloud computing** is,

> The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Let's start with 

**`IT resources`**

in the context of cloud computing. this term encompasses a big range of services and capabilities. let me give some examples.

- **Compute power**
  
  Basically, you're able to rent and use thousands of ready-to-use computers whenever you like without the pain of building the infrastructure yourself!

- **Storage**
  
  would you like to make sure your data is 99.999999999% safe? well, storing in cloud is your friend!

- **Networking**
  
  blazing fast internet connection? yep, we've got you covered!

- **Databases**

- **Analytics**

- **Machine Learning**

- **etc..**

**`on demand`**

Want to get 1000 TiBs of storage right now? no problem! What about 5000 computers? absolutely! Just give the word, and everything will be at your fingertips!

**`pay-as-you-go`**

So, there are all sorts of pricing plans out there, but this particular one is what makes cloud computing unique. Let's say you've got this big job that needs some serious computing power, and you're thinking of buying some computers to get it done. Now comes the fun part – setting them all up and getting them connected. After all that effort, you finally finish the job and it's all good, right? Well, not exactly. You're left with a bunch of extra computers just sitting there doing nothing. It's like you wasted all that time, money, and energy on setting up your infrastructure instead of actually doing what you wanted to do in the first place. But with the cloud, you can skip all that pain! You can create the resources you need in minutes instead of waiting weeks or months. And when you're done with them, just delete them. Plus, you only pay for the compute power you actually used. So much easier, right?

### Cloud Providers

there're numerous cloud service providers out in the wild. However, **AWS** or Amazon Web Services is by far the largest cloud provider with about 34% cloud market share! Some other cloud providers are:

- Microsoft Azure.

- GCP (google cloud platform)

- Huawei

- etc..

In my opinion, **AWS** is the one with the most crystal-clear guidance on navigating the cloud! 

### AWS Skill Builder.

[This platform](https://skillbuilder.aws/) is your go-to for starting your journey in the cloud! They provide a wide range of both free and paid courses that cover the core concepts of cloud computing. Plus, you can earn badges to showcase your understanding of the cloud!

## Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner
