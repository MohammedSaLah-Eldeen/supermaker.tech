# Huh? What do you mean by "I need to learn soft skills"?

One night, I was chatting with a friend when they sent me a link to **Forward** a program to teach soft skills from *Mckinsey*.
**Huh?** Do people attend programs to acquire soft skills? don't we acquire and learn them by interacting with others in the professional world?
**Now I'm a bit curious and skeptical**
I knew little about soft skills and how important they were. for me at that time, soft skills were the skills that - in my opinion - I need no mentor to teach me, but I learn them through experience and they're job specific, so the skillset for a job is different than the skillset for another. things that are like:

* presenting things to people.
* keeping people engaged.
* effective communication.
* persuading others.
* etc...

since I was motivated enough, I applied.

## First day in the program

Super! I got an email telling me that I've been accepted!
![confirmation email](img/img-posts/mckinsey-forward-foundation/mckinsey-accepted.png "Yay! I got into the program!")

I was even able to access the ***McKinsey Learning Platform*** earlier than the start date of the program. after playing around here and there on the platform for some time I was hooked! it's fantastic, minimal but most importantly was super professional!

we were asked to pick a day for a welcome meeting and to download the `Foundation Handbook` of the program to understand it more and wow! it really went beyond
my expectations.

The `Foundation Handbook` wasn't just a simple brochure of some info on the program, rather it was an amazing source to all of my journey! It contains well-made summaries of each lesson of every module with an interactive box at the bottom to jot down some notes and at the end of each module an interactive box to write down your reflection of the module  as a whole and what you learned.

### The Program has 3 levels!

* **Foundation**: This is the level I was in and I finished!
  we'll start learning on some of the basic and important skills to navigate our lives in our fast-paced world.
* **Advanced**: The next level where I continue to build on all of the concepts and skills that I learned is the Foundation Level.
* **Network**: a chance to expand your network and apply all the learned concepts throughout the program.

### Reflecting on the journey ahead.

**`What are my goals?`**

- **Learn** what it takes to be a great communicator, a passionate leader and a confident individual. 

- **Understand** how soft skills are relevant in the real world. 

**`What am I most excited about this program?`**

- **Learn** the things that would make me more valuable and could give me a push and an advantage in the professional world.

Even though I had the ability to start making some progress before the start date. I really wanted to start on the specified date to really understand how I would perform.

## Foundation Level Walkthrough

The level was divided into 4 modules:

1. Adaptability & Resilience.
2. Problem Solving.
3. Communication for Impact.
4. Digital Essentials.

### Adaptability & Resilience

Nowadays, we live in a world with a lot of things happening around us that we can't even begin to process. Being adaptable and resilient help us keep ourselves flexible and valuable in our fast-paced world. 

#### Setting Meaningful Learning Intentions

"*Cut through the world noise, focus on the most relevant to you!*"

if you need to learn something, you might as well make sure that you will enjoy learning it! for this reason once you approach a new thing your desired outcome should be a learning intention, not a performance measure. Learning Intentions priortize the experience itself, discovering new things and not just the outcome which might be hard and frustrating to get yourself around causing you to quit learning process itself!

> **Basically**, you need to struggle a bit to learn, to feel that you're learning new things, only then you'll feel the joy of learning but not to the point where you feel it's super painful to continue learning.

#### Learning Intentions vs. Performance Measures.

"*You're no magician, everything needs time and effort, no one gets it the first time. Embrace the struggle, hardwork and your journey*"

just for a second, suppose that you want to learn programming, you absolutely have no idea what programming is and how should you go about learning it.

if you start by saying i want to build a big app like instagram or facebook right off the bat, Congrats! it's more likely that you'll quit programming all together! However, if you start by discovering what is programming, how apps work, what are the basics you should know and how to create your study plan, you'll be able to start making progress more rapidly! only when you get some experience you can start thinking about building your favorite app!

> **to summarize**
> 
> - At the beginning, focus on dicovering things.
> 
> - In the middle, discover more, but challenge yourself to test your learned knowledge.
> 
> - At the end, you'll have learned the needed skills, more challenges will give you the correct experience.

### Problem Solving

### Communication for Impact
