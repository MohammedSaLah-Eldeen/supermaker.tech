Let’s start with IT resources in the context of cloud computing. this term encompasses a big range of services and capabilities. let me give some examples. Compute power Basically, you’re able to rent and use thousands of ready-to-use computers whenever you like without the pain of building the infrastructure yourself! Storage would you like to make sure your data is 99.999999999% safe? well, storing in cloud is your friend! Networking blazing fast internet connection? yep, we’ve got you covered! Databases Analytics Machine Learning etc.. on demand Want to get 1000 TiBs of storage right now? no problem! What about 5000 computers? absolutely! Just give the word, and everything will be at your fingertips! pay-as-you-go So, there are all sorts of pricing plans out there, but this particular one is what makes cloud computing unique. Let’s say you’ve got this big job that needs some serious computing power, and you’re thinking of buying some computers to get it done. Now comes the fun part – setting them all up and getting them connected. After all that effort, you finally finish the job and it’s all good, right? Well, not exactly. You’re left with a bunch of extra computers just sitting there doing nothing. It’s like you wasted all that time, money, and energy on setting up your infrastructure instead of actually doing what you wanted to do in the first place. But with the cloud, you can skip all that pain! You can create the resources you need in minutes instead of waiting weeks or months. And when you’re done with them, just delete them. Plus, you only pay for the compute power you actually used. So much easier, right?

Now I’m a bit curious and skeptical I knew little about soft skills and how important they were. for me at that time, soft skills were the skills that - in my opinion - I need no mentor to teach me, but I learn them through experience and they’re job specific, so the skillset for a job is different than the skillset for another. things that are like: presenting things to people. keeping people engaged. effective communication. persuading others. etc… since I was motivated enough, I applied.

To communicate professionally and efficiently, you need to define your purpose as specific as possible. Heads, Hearts, and Hands. To define your purpose, it’s very useful to ask yourself these three questions. What do you want your audience to understand? How do you want your audience to feel? What do you want your audience to do? If defining purpose is like an entrance to a conversation, then defining Insight is your exit out of it! INSIGHTThink of it simply as the desired things or the message that the other person should leave the conversation with. such as: Important Info on something that they need to consider. A decision they must make. etc.. for the other person to really understand your message. you don’t just present it right away! It’s advisible to provide your message in a structured and coherent manner. One of the most useful ways to do that is to use the pyramid method Pyramid Method One of the most useful methods to structure your arguments. it consists of: Governing Thought One sentence statement of your message: a problem, a solution, etc.. Key Line Statements The why and how of that message. Supporting Evidence To each one of Key Line Statement Although the Pyramid is presented from top ","date":"2024-01-20","objectID":"/posts/mckinsey-forward-foundation/:2:2","series":["mckinsey"],"tags":["softskills","problem solving","adaptability \u0026 resilience","digital transformation","communication for impact"],"title":"Forward, a spectacular journey!

Some problems are urgent thus requiring our immediate attention, others aren’t as urgent and have a window of time, typically a couple of days or weeks to think and construct a solution. Some problems need a specific and final answer, whether the answer was purely quantitative or qualitative in nature, others require developing new creative ideas and innovations. Before contining, I’d like to make a claim. About 95% of people around the world solve problems based on hunch and instinct! While solving problems this way isn’t entirely a bad thing, following a systematic approach to problem solving would yield much more useful answers at the end because: You would be able to identifiy all the possible elements of a problem, thus gaining: complete understanding of the problem. the ability to focus on its important parts. a sense of its potential solutions and uncertainties. You would be able to save more time and effort as going through a step-by-step approach efficiently guides you throught your problem solving journey. Established Approaches Hypothesis-led A flexible, scalable, broadly applicable seven-step approach. Domain IP-led An accelerated version of the hypothesis-led approach, requiring expertise relevant to the problem. Advanced Analytics Approaches to arrive at non-obvious insights from big data. Design Thinking A people-centric approach with an emphasis on prototyping and user feedback. Engineering An experiment-based approach that uses rapid prototyping to de-risk In the course we’ve only taken a simple introduction on the Hypothesis-led Approach and we’ll dive deeply into it in the advanced phase! I feel really motivated and happy!\rNo matter what I say, truly the amount and quality of the information and guidance provided in the Forward program is really worth its weight in gold! At the end, I’d like to thank you for reading this blog post I really appreciate it and you’re the best! Thanks again! and bye! Astrodev.
