## Huh? What do you mean by "I need to learn soft skills"?

I was chatting with a friend one night when they sent me a link to **Forward** a program to teach soft skills from *Mckinsey*.
**Huh?** Do people need special programs to acquire these skills? couldn't we only acquire and learn them by interacting with others and on a job in the professional world?

###### **Now I'm curious**

I knew little about soft skills and how important they were at the time. for me, soft skills were the skills that I needed no mentor to teach me, but I can learn them through trial and error specific to a job and a selected career. things that are like: 
* presentation skills.
* storytelling.
* communication.
* persuading.
* etc...

since I was curious and motivated enough, I applied.

## First day in the program.

Super! I got an email telling me that I've been accepted! 
![confirmation email](img/img-posts/mckinsey-forward-foundation/mckinsey-accepted.png "Yay! I got into the program!")

I was even able to access the ***McKinsey Learning Platform*** earlier than the start date of the program. after playing around here and there on the platform for some time I was hooked! it's fantastic, minimal but most importantly was super professional!

we were asked to pick a day pick for a welcome meeting and to download the `The Foundation Handbook` to the program.

### The Program has 3 levels!
* **Foundation**: This is the level I'm currently in and I finished!
* **Advanced**: The next level where I continue to build on all of the concepts I learned is the Foundation Level.
* **Network**: a chance to expand your network and apply all the learned concepts throughout the program.

> Even though I had the ability to start making some progress before the start date. However, I wanted to really start on the specified date to examine how I would perform.

## Foundation Level Walkthrough
The level was divided into 4 sections:
1. Adaptability & Resilience.
2. Problem Solving.
3. Communication for Impact.
4. Digital Essentials.

### Adaptability & Resilience
