# Huh? What do you mean by "I need to learn soft skills"?

One night, I was chatting with a friend when they sent me a link to **Forward** a program to teach soft skills from *Mckinsey*.
**Huh?** Do people attend programs to acquire soft skills? don't we acquire and learn them by interacting with others in the professional world?
**Now I'm a bit curious and skeptical**
I knew little about soft skills and how important they were. for me at that time, soft skills were the skills that - in my opinion - I need no mentor to teach me, but I learn them through experience and they're job specific, so the skillset for a job is different than the skillset for another. things that are like:

* presenting things to people.
* keeping people engaged.
* effective communication.
* persuading others.
* etc...

since I was motivated enough, I applied.

## First day in the program

Super! I got an email telling me that I've been accepted!
![confirmation email](img/img-posts/mckinsey-forward-foundation/mckinsey-accepted.png "Yay! I got into the program!")

I was even able to access the ***McKinsey Learning Platform*** earlier than the start date of the program. after playing around here and there on the platform for some time I was hooked! it's fantastic, minimal but most importantly was super professional!

we were asked to pick a day for a welcome meeting and to download the `The Foundation Handbook` of the program to understand it more and wow! it really went beyond
my expectations.

### The Program has 3 levels!

* **Foundation**: This is the level I was in and I finished!
we'll start learning on some of the basic and important skills to navigate our lives in our fast-paced world.
* **Advanced**: The next level where I continue to build on all of the concepts and skills that I learned is the Foundation Level.
* **Network**: a chance to expand your network and apply all the learned concepts throughout the program.

> Even though I had the ability to start making some progress before the start date. I really wanted to start on the specified date to really understand how I would perform.

## Foundation Level Walkthrough

The level was divided into 4 sections:

1. Adaptability & Resilience.
2. Problem Solving.
3. Communication for Impact.
4. Digital Essentials.
